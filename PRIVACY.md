## Guilds

For guilds (Discord servers), Algalon stores your Discord Guild ID and the game branches your guild wants notifications for. Additionally, it also stores the channel ID used to send these notifications.

## Users

Algalon does **not** store any user data for users that are not using direct message notifications.

When using direct message notifications, Algalon will store your Discord User ID along with the branches you want updates for.
